# Python customer segmentation and clustering

Problem statement:
Understand the target market to enable the marketing team to formulate a strategy.

Hypothetical contex:
I need to identify the most important shopping groups based on income, age, and mall shopping score.

Business objective:
Divide the mall's target market into approachable groups. Create subsets of a market based on demographic characteristics, bettering the company's understanding of the target market and improving marketing strategies.

# My approach (customer segmentation, python clustering, and machine learning):

To identify the best possible cluster I used the KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clusters.  Once these clusters are identified, summary statistics were be performed to identify the best marketing group.

(Exploratory data analysis included creating basic statistical summaries and visualisations)

# Results

- Clusters 1 and 2 would be a good target group as they had high spending scores.

The segmentation enables a deep-dive analysis into the demographic profiles of Clusters 1 and 2. These insights will be presented to cross-functional stakeholders to facilitate data-driven, personalized engagement strategies for high-value segments.
